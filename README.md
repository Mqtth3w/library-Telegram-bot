 The deployment only takes less than 10 minutes.
  
- Create a new bot on telegram with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather). Save the api token for future use.
- Create a Cloudflare account.
- Go to workers & pages then create a new worker so deploy it.
- Click edit so replace the code with the content of [lib_tel_bot.js](./lib_tel_bot.js). Deploy it.
- Click configure worker, go to setting, go to variables.
- Add the variable API_KEY (secret type). Which is the bot api token.
- Add the variable SECRET_TOKEN (secret type). Generate its value through the script [gen_token.py](./gen_token.py). You can also type it with your hands (1-256 characters. Only characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` are allowed). Save it for future use.
- **Optionally** you can add a variable GBOOKS_API_KEY (secret type), which is a Google API key restricted to the Books API service. It let you do more requests, generally you don't need it unless you plan to do thousands of requests per day.
- Encrypt (set the secrect type!) all variables and save.

- ### DB setup
  Follow the instructions in the DB setup [file](./README2.md).

- ### Webhook
  Open the following link after substitution to configure webhook.
  ```
  https://api.telegram.org/bot<replace with your bot api token>/setWebhook?url=<replace with your worker url>&secret_token=<replace with your secret token>
  ```
  You should see something like {"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"} then the bot works.
  <br><br>
  If you filled wrong info or need to update info you can delete webhook and then you can set it again. Open the following link after substitution to delete webhook.
  ```
  https://api.telegram.org/bot<replace with your bot api token>/deleteWebhook
  ```
